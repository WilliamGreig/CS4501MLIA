Machine Learning in Image Analysis
Fall 2023

-------
PS3[II]
-------

1. Open Jupyter Notebook in UVA Rivanna
2. Upload the zip file and unzip
3. In the "layers.py" file, you need to write your EpDiff function in the forward function of the VecInt class (line 64)
3. Run all the cells in the training.ipynb
	- Your trained model (named as 'reg_model.pth') will be automatically saved after running the last cell
4. Run all the cells in the testing.ipynb
	- You need to save the deformed images (pred[0]) and transformation fields (pred[1]) in the testing loop


**** Keep all the files in the same folder. Otherwise you might face difficulties in running the codes



Best of Luck!!!
